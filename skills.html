    <h3>Hard Skills 💪🏾</h3>
    <h4>English</h4>
    <p>Learning and evenutally teaching the English Language has been one of my biggest life accomplishments. 
        <br> From Grammar to Phonetics, Learning and Teaching Techniques, I've acquired a long experience of over 13 years. <br> The company I founded with my wife is an Online English Training platform called Dialektos.

    <h4>Supply Chain Management</h4>
    <p>I have a master's degree in Supply Management. I spent most of employee career working as an Operations specialist, purchasing and procurement professional. <br> 
    I can use SAP well and handle purchasing orders seamlessly.</p> 
     
    <h4>Operations and Processes</h4>
    <p>One of the things that I like and excel at is  going from a goal, bringing the right people or/and resources together and make it happen.I like to set up documents, policies, day-to-day operations and clear collaboration schemes for my team.<br> 
        I can use SAP well and handle purchasing orders seamlessly.</p> 
    </p>    

    <h3>Soft Skills 💪🏾</h3>
    <h4>Workaround Solution Finding</h4>
    <p>With the resources at my disposal, I can achieve great things. For example, I started my company with just my laptop from a corner of my room. I did that for 1 year before moving into an proper office.</p>
    
    <h4>Empathy</h4>
    <p>I can easily share the feelings of a person who is going through turbulent moments.</p>

    <h4>Self-Stater</h4>
    <p>As a person, I'm self motivated and self starting. I don't generally need someone to tell me what to do and when to do it. For example, as I was in school, I learned English on my own for years without my parents even knowing. 
        <br>However, I happen to feel depressed at times and when that occurs, I want a warming voice to tell me that I'm worth a lot, that I can make and that I'm loved.
