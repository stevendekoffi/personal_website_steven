    <h4>Dialektos</h4>
    <p>Dialektos is a project that my wife a I put together to help people learning English 10 times faster by providing them with quality content and currated tips and tricks that have proved to be efficient over time. 
        <br> We use Zoom, Calendly and Google Docs Apps to seamlessly and cost-effectively to manage all our learners and we're doing quite well.

    <h4>Siemens Energy</h4>
    <p>I worked for 8 months at SIEMENS ENERGY as Supply Chain Specialist. The project that I was committed to was to duplicate the international supply chain procedure of SIEMENS ENERGY in Cote d'Ivoire. 
     
    <h4>Glovo</h4>
    <p>
       Glovo was my most fun and enriching (startup) experience. 
    I started out as an  operations coordinator, dealing with recruiting and training more than 500 couriers. After 3 months, I got promoted to Operations Analyst, which is where I learned a bit of data analysis with SQL.</p>
