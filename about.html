    <h4>Likes and dislikes</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Food Preference</li>
            <p>In terms of food, I like all sorts of Ivorian food, but my favorite Ivoirian dish is <b>Foutou Sauce arachide</b>. <br>
            I'm also a big fan of Lebanese food and every I want to take my wife out, we try anad new lebanese restaurant.</p>
            <li>Human Interactions</li>
            <p>I see myself as an ambivert person. As a matter of fact, in some instance, I can be quite a talkative person. <br>
                Some other days, I like to be silent and listen to people, it appears to be that silence has its own charm. <br>
            I like to always be joyful and I smile with everybody. <em>I will always stay away from a frown face.</em></p>
                
            <li>Pet peeve</li>
            <p>My pet peeves are <i><b>centipedes</b></i> ð“†¨   ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®. I hate them and I hate any place that is prone to having them, like humid place.</p>
